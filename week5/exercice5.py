"""
[Weekly Python Exercise 2020 A2] Exercise #5 â€” Files by size:
The idea is to write a function that takes any number of open (for reading) file-like objects.
For each of these objects, you are to return a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary should contain two keys:
"name" (containing the filename)
"size" (the size, in characters)

The list of dicts should be sorted by file size, from smallest to largest.

Hint: You might want to write an additional function that creates the dict, based on the current file.
